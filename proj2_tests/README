Scripts for testing project 2
These will be used for grading the project, but they should be useful
in development too. 

Use the .sh version for Linux and Mac (use chmod +x *.sh first)
Use the .cmd version for Windows

Usage:
On topcat or Mac: running servertest1.sh to test username's proj2_server:
servertest1.sh username  (after chmod +x *.sh)

On development Windows PC system, with project at
   htdocs/cs637/username/pizza2_server:
servertest1 username

servertest1: day, toppings, sizes, users
servertest2: get and place orders, some with problems
servertest3: update order, get order 1
