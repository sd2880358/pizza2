README for ch05_gs_server

This project is set up to be installed at /cs637/username/ch05_gs_server
relative to the document root, where username is your pe07 username.

On pe07, this project is meant to be installed at
/var/www/html/cs637/username/ch05_gs_server.
You have private access to this area using UNIX file permissions,
just as you have private access to your ~/cs637 directory area.

To be ready to run this project, you need to edit in your
pe07 username in just one place in these sources, api/index.php,
as explained in a comment in that file.

You also need to make sure the guitarshop database is loaded--see
the files in the database directory.

Note that Netbeans will put a red exclamation point on the vendor directory
because one of its modules, called pimple, doesn't validate to Netbean's
satisfaction. It will also mark brokenproduct.json this way, because it's
bad JSON, intentionally. Don't worry about these markings.
